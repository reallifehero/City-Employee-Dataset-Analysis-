Data Location: https://data.baltimorecity.gov/City-Government/Baltimore-City-Employee-Salaries-FY2018/biyh-j8tc

Descriptions:

The data provides us with the salary of the employees of the City of Baltimore for year 2018. I also work for the City of Baltimore. So Iâ€™m familiar with content of the dataset. The data was discovered from the sources the professor had provided. The data is relevant to Data Science because I will be able to mine useful information from it. I will visualize the data using graphs and charts.
There is no documented EDA for this dataset as far as I have seen. The data consists of the following information: Name, Job title, Department ID, Description, Hire Date, Annual Income, and Gross Salary. The dataset has 13682 rows and 7 columns. The data is 5.3 megabytes.
